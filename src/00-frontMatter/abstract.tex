\noindent This software development project aims to digitize the teacher attendance management process at Pondok Modern Al-Ghozali, which was previously handled manually by the Head of Department and required an efficient system for processing fingerprint data and managing leave requests. The intern served as both Project Manager and Backend Developer, applying the Scrum methodology with weekly sprint cycles. Main tasks included project timeline planning, backend development using the Django framework, and data processing with the Pandas library. The resulting functional web application features a statistical attendance dashboard, automated XLS file processing, and WhatsApp-based leave integration, providing practical experience in technical team management and implementation of complex business logic while being highly relevant to Artificial Intelligence, Data Science Fundamentals, and Platform-Based Programming courses.

\noindent This software development aims to digitize the teacher attendance management process, which has been manually handled by the Head of Division at Al-Ghozali Modern Islamic Boarding School, requiring an efficient system for processing fingerprint data. The intern served as both Project Manager and Backend Developer, employing the Scrum development methodology using a weekly sprint cycle. The primary work included timeline planning, backend development using the Django framework, and data processing using the Pandas library. The project's output is a functional web application with a statistical dashboard and automated XLS file processing, implementing complex business logic relevant to the courses in Artificial Intelligence, Fundamental Data Science, and Platform-Based Programming.
